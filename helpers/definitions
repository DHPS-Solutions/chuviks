cube representation:
9 pieces per face. 6 faces.
Assuming the cubes faces are layed out flat
color, position in space -> array position
green, front -> 0th face
orange, left -> 1st face
red, right -> 2nd face
white, up -> 3rd face
yellow, down -> 4th face
blue, back -> 5th face

piece representation;
0 -> green
1 -> orange
2 -> red
3 -> white
4 -> yellow
5 -> blue

cube rotations:
R:
    green to white
    [0][2] -> [3][2]
    [0][5] -> [3][5]
    [0][8] -> [3][8]

    white to blue
    [3][2] -> [5][2]
    [3][5] -> [5][5]
    [3][8] -> [5][8]

    blue to yellow
    [5][2] -> [4][2]
    [5][5] -> [4][5]
    [5][8] -> [4][8]
    
    yellow to green
    [4][2] -> [0][2]
    [4][5] -> [0][5]
    [4][8] -> [0][8]

    rotate entire red face

L:
    white to green
    [3][0] -> [0][0]
    [3][3] -> [0][3]
    [3][6] -> [0][6]

    green to yellow
    [0][0] -> [4][0]
    [0][3] -> [4][3]
    [0][6] -> [4][6]

    yellow to blue
    [4][0] -> [5][0]
    [4][3] -> [5][3]
    [4][6] -> [5][6]

    blue to white
    [5][0] -> [3][0]
    [5][3] -> [3][3]
    [5][6] -> [3][6]
